Gene | Patient ID --> all mutated

BRCA.maf2dat.matrix.out.test
Gene ID | Patient ID | # Mutations | Gene | File Name for Patient ID again

result/ACC2HIT/BRCA/BRCA-combinations

2 gene combo | F-max score | IDK
- Combinations output: 2-gene combo | F-max score | Additional metrics

So the validate2hit.sh script (which you're correct, it's not in the repo) simply runs both of the following:
-  ./validate2hit ../data/maf2dat-moderate/BRCA.maf2dat.matrix.out.test ../result/BRCA/BRCA-combinations     
python validateNormal2hit.py ../data/maf2dat-moderate/manifest_normal_normal.txt.test.txt.geneSampleList ../result/BRCA/BRCA-combinations 
The output tells you how many combinations were in the test set as well as the coverage percentage
You want to maximize the percentage for the tumor matrix and minimize it for the nomal samples.
